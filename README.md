# [mbus-httpd](https://github.com/packom/mbus-httpd)

An HTTP microservice exposing (wired) M-Bus functionality, allowing you to scan an M-Bus and query M-Bus slaves.

You'll need a serial - M-Bus device to connect your server to an M-Bus.

If you want to use a Raspberry Pi and want an M-Bus Master Hat, see [here](https://www.packom.net/m-bus-master-hat/).  Alternatively

* buy a USB M-Bus Master device from ebay or aliexpress
* build your own using widely available [schematics](https://otb-iot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mbus.html).

## Quickstart

The easiest way to run mbus-httpd is to use a pre-built container, using docker.  An mbus-httpd docker manifest is available which supports:

* x86_64
* ARMv8 (64-bit) & ARMv7 (32-bit) which together cover all Raspberry Pi models except the zero and original Pi (for which building a container is extremely painful!).

If you need docker the easiest way to get it is to run:

```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh
```

Once docker is installed (and you may need to logout and back in after installing) you can run mbus-httpd using the following (replacing ttyAMA0 with your serial device):

```
docker run --name mbus \
          -d -p 8080:8080 \
          -e RUST_LOG=INFO \
          --device /dev/ttyAMA0:/dev/ttyAMA0 \
          packom/mbus-release
```

This will start the mbus-httpd web server listening on port 8080.

If you're using an [M-Bus Master Hat](https://www.packom.net/m-bus-master-hat/) run the container like this instead:

```
docker run --name mbus \
           -d -p 8080:8080 \
           -e RUST_LOG=INFO \
           --device /dev/ttyAMA0:/dev/ttyAMA0 \
           -v /proc/device-tree/hat:/proc/device-tree/hat \
           --privileged \
           packom/mbus-release
```

To check whether it is working, from another shell run:

```
curl -v -X GET http://localhost:8080/mbus/api
```

Or, modify this as appropriate and stick in a browser:

```
http://<your_host_name>:8080/mbus/api 
```

The [YAML API document](https://github.com/packom/mbus-httpd/blob/master/api/openapi.yaml) should be returned.

## Using

If you're using an [M-Bus Master Hat](https://www.packom.net/m-bus-master-hat/) you can check that it is physically installed corrected by running:

```
curl -v -X GET http://localhost:8080/mbus/hat
```

You should be a response like:

```
{
  "product":"M-Bus Master",
  "productId":"0x0001",
  "productVer":"0x0002",
  "uuid":"abcdef12-abcd-abcd-abcd-123456abcdef",
  "vendor":"packom.net"
}
```

You need to power on the M-Bus if using an M-Bus Master Hat using:

```
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8080/mbus/hat/on
```

To scan the M-Bus connected to device /dev/ttyAMA0 at 2400 baud:

```
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8080/mbus/scan/ttyAMA0/2400
```

To get info from a device address 48 (0x30):

```
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8080/mbus/get/ttyAMA0/2400/48
```

## Building

### Easy way

This will build a container with all the necessary stuff.

```
docker build .
```

(The Dockerfile and other pieces in ci are deprecated - they are a way to build a very minimal container with muslc - but this is painful to maintain.)

### Hard way

To build you'll need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.  If you don't want to go to the effort of installing Rust, you can use a [build container supporting Rust](https://piers.rocks/docker/containers/raspberry/pi/rust/cross/compile/compilation/2018/12/16/rust-compilation-for-raspberry-pi.html) such as [this one](https://hub.docker.com/r/piersfinlayson/build), which works on x86_64, ARMv6 and ARMv7 (so all flavours of Raspberry Pis):

```
docker run --rm -ti -v some_local_dir:/home/build/builds piersfinlayson/build
```

Once Rust is installed run:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/packom/mbus-httpd
cd mbus-httpd
cargo build
```

You also need libmbus.  On Ubuntu you can install like this:

```
sudo apt install libtool autoconf
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/rscada/libmbus
cd libmbus
./build.sh
sudo make install
```

## Running

To run:

```
cd ~/mbus-httpd
cargo run
```

As mbus-httpd is designed to run in a container, all configuration is done by environment variables.  You'll almost certainly want:

```
LIBMBUS_PATH=<limbus binary path e.g. ~/libmbus/bin>
LD_LIBRARY_PATH<path libmbus.so is installed to e.g. /usr/local/lib>
```

You may also want:

```
SERVER_IP=<IP to listen on>
SERVER_PORT=<port to listen on>
RUST_LOG=<log level, e.g. INFO>
```

So for example:

```
cd ~/mbus-httpd
env SERVER_IP=localhost \
env SERVER_PORT=8080 \
env LIBMBUS_PATH=~/libmbus/bin \
env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib \
env RUST_LOG=INFO \
cargo run
```

### Clients

A sample mbus-httpd client implemented in Rust is provided.  To build and run:

```
cargo run --example hat-tester
```

This is designed to do functional and burn-in testing of the [M-Bus Master Hat](https://www.packom.net/m-bus-master-hat/), and is fairly self-explanatory.

To run, doing a full suite of tests on an M-Bus Master Hat:

```
cargo run --example hat-tester -- \
          --host localhost \
          --port 8080 \
          --address 48 \
          --baudrate 2400 \
          --device ttyAMA0 \
          --reps 10 \
          --get-reps 100 \
          --hat \
          --scan \
          --check-scan \
          --product-ver 0x0002 \
          --uuid=148f8981-033b-407a-a13f-72405d08e0fe
```

To run on another type of M-Bus Master, connected at device /dev/ttyUSB0 use like this:

```
cargo run --example hat-tester -- \
          --host localhost \
          --port 8080 \
          --address 48 \
          --baudrate 2400 \
          --device ttyUSB0 \
          --scan \
          --check-scan
```

To get help on and see other command-line options:

```
cargo run --example hat-tester -- --help
```

### Debugging

To view logs, make sure RUST_LOG is set to INFO or DEBUG (see above).  If running in a shell the logs will be output to stdout.  If running within docker you can view the logs using:

```
docker logs -f mbus
```
